title: NIAID Data Ecosystem KG
description: The nde (NIAID Data Ecosystem) KG contains infectious and immune-mediated disease datasets. These include datasets from NIAID-funded repositories as well as globally-relevant infectious and immune-mediated disease (IID) repositories from NIH and beyond. The datasets include -omics data, clinical data, epidemiological data, pathogen-host interaction data, flow cytometry, and imaging.

The nde (NIAID Data Ecosystem) KG contains infectious and immune-mediated disease datasets. These include datasets from NIAID-funded repositories as well as globally-relevant infectious and immune-mediated disease (IID) repositories from NIH and beyond. The datasets include -omics data, clinical data, epidemiological data, pathogen-host interaction data, flow cytometry, and imaging.

The NIAID Data Ecosystem (NDE) Knowledge Graph provides structured metadata for infectious and immune-mediated disease (IID) research resources. Developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in collaboration with Scripps Research, this knowledge graph powers the NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal (https://data.niaid.nih.gov), which aggregates millions of datasets from over 70 sources including NIAID-funded repositories and globally-relevant IID repositories.

The knowledge graph organizes metadata using Schema.org vocabulary, enabling unified search across diverse biomedical data types including -omics data, clinical studies, epidemiological data, pathogen-host interactions, flow cytometry, and imaging datasets. It connects datasets to their authors, funding sources, research projects, publications, and key disease and pathogen terms, facilitating discovery of resources related to COVID-19, HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases. By harmonizing heterogeneous metadata formats and providing both user-friendly search interfaces and programmatic API access, the NDE knowledge graph accelerates IID research and maximizes the impact of publicly-funded scientific data.
