SUDOKN is an interconnected network of publicly available manufacturing capability data focused on Small and Medium-Sized Manufacturers.

SUDOKN (Supply and Demand Open Knowledge Network) is a specialized knowledge graph connecting publicly available manufacturing capability data for Small and Medium-Sized Manufacturers (SMMs) across the United States. The graph contains detailed information about manufacturing organizations, their process capabilities (machining, welding, coating, finishing, 3D printing), material processing expertise (metals, plastics, composites), quality certifications (ISO 9000/9001, AS9100/9102), and industry alignments (aerospace, automotive, electronics, food processing). Each manufacturer is geolocated with postal addresses, coordinates, and regional identifiers, and linked to NAICS industry classifications. SUDOKN leverages the Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF) core ontologies for semantic interoperability, enabling federation with other manufacturing and supply chain knowledge graphs. The dataset supports supplier discovery, capability matching, and supply chain risk analysis.
