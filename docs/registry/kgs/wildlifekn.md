This project seeks to create a comprehensive, integrative knowledge network for the management of wildlife in the context of climate change.

Wildlife-KN is a comprehensive knowledge network designed for wildlife researchers, conservation managers, and policymakers addressing biodiversity challenges under climate change. The graph integrates data on wildlife species, habitat characteristics, environmental variables, geographic distributions, and climate projections to enable cross-domain analysis of how changing conditions affect wildlife populations and ecosystems. Built to support interdisciplinary inquiry, Wildlife-KN links biological observations with geospatial, temporal, and climatological data, facilitating queries about species vulnerability, habitat suitability shifts, and conservation prioritization. The knowledge graph employs standard semantic web vocabularies (RDFS, SKOS, Schema.org, GeoSPARQL) and cross-links to authoritative biodiversity databases, enabling federation with other OKN Theme-1 resources.
