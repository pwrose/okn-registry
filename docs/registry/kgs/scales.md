SCALES is an integrated justice platform to connect criminal justice data across data silos.

SCALES (Systematic Content Analysis of Litigation Events) is an open knowledge network designed to democratize access to criminal and civil court records across the United States. The knowledge graph contains over 523 million triples describing 96.5 million entities spanning more than 4.1 million cases, including 2.4 million criminal cases and 1.8 million civil cases. The graph integrates data from federal district courts as well as state and local court systems, linking entities such as parties, attorneys, law firms, judges, charges, sentences, arrests, and bookings across cases. Built on the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) Justice Domain standard, SCALES employs standardized vocabularies to enable systematic analysis of justice system functioning, reveal inequities, and support evidence-based policy making. The platform addresses the critical lack of nationally-accessible and linked criminal justice data.
